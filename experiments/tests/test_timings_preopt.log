2025-09-20 03:15:15,656 [INFO ]  --- Test Case: Comparative Question (DeepSeek-R1 Paper) ---
2025-09-20 03:15:15,656 [INFO ]  Query: How does DeepSeek-R1's performance on the AIME 2024 benchmark compare to OpenAI-01-1217?

2025-09-20 03:15:15,659 [INFO ]  The provided sources do not explicitly compare DeepSeek-R1's performance on the AIME 2024 benchmark directly to OpenAI-o1-1217. However, they do mention that DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates performance "on par with OpenAI-o1-1217" on math tasks in general. 

For the AIME 2024 benchmark specifically, the sources only provide data for **DeepSeek-R1-Zero** (71.0% pass@1) and **OpenAI-o1-0912** (74.4% pass@1). Since the query refers to **OpenAI-o1-1217**, which is not included in the benchmark results, there is no direct comparison available in the provided context. 

In summary:  
- DeepSeek-R1 is stated to be comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on math tasks broadly.  
- For the AIME 2024 benchmark, the only direct comparison in the sources is between DeepSeek-R1-Zero (71.0%) and OpenAI-o1-0912 (74.4%).  
- OpenAI-o1-1217's performance on AIME 2024 is not specified in the provided sources.

2025-09-20 03:15:33,506 [INFO ]  --- Test Case: Numerical/Detailed Question (Attention Paper) ---
2025-09-20 03:15:33,506 [INFO ]  Query: In the 'Attention is All You Need' paper, what were the training costs for the big Transformer model?

2025-09-20 03:15:33,509 [INFO ]  In the "Attention Is All You Need" paper, the training costs for the **big Transformer model** are explicitly mentioned as follows:  
- **Training duration**: 3.5 days.  
- **Hardware**: Eight GPUs (specifically, the abstract notes training on eight GPUs for the English-to-French task, while source 1 specifies the big models were trained on a machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs).  

This training time is significantly shorter than the training costs of prior state-of-the-art models, which required substantially more computational resources and time. The big model's efficiency is highlighted as a key advantage of the Transformer architecture.

2025-09-20 03:15:33,512 [INFO ]  All claims in the generated answer are explicitly supported by the sources. The training duration of 3.5 days and use of eight GPUs for the big model are directly stated in Source 1 and Source 3. The comparison to prior models' training costs is also supported by the source's mention of the big model's training cost being a 'small fraction' of previous models.

2025-09-20 03:15:45,534 [INFO ]  --- Test Case: Limitation Inquiry (DeepSeek-V3 Paper) ---
2025-09-20 03:15:45,534 [INFO ]  Query: What are the limitations of the DeepSeek-V3 model regarding deployment?

2025-09-20 03:15:45,537 [INFO ]  The DeepSeek-V3 model has two notable limitations regarding deployment, as outlined in the sources:  

1. **Large Recommended Deployment Unit**: To ensure efficient inference, DeepSeek-V3 requires a relatively large deployment unit. This could pose challenges or a burden for smaller teams with limited resources or infrastructure, as deploying such a large unit may be cost-prohibitive or logistically difficult.  

2. **Room for Improvement in Generation Speed**: While the deployment strategy achieved an end-to-end generation speed over twice that of DeepSeek-V2, there is still potential for further optimization. The sources suggest that advancements in hardware could naturally address these limitations in the future.  

These deployment challenges are contextualized as temporary constraints, with the expectation that hardware progress will mitigate them over time.
